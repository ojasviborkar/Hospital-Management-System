# 🏥 Hospital Management System

## 📖 Overview
The **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is designed to automate and simplify hospital operations.  
It integrates patient, doctor, staff, appointment, billing, and lab data within a unified database system.  
The system provides both a **web-based interface** for hospital staff and a **mobile app** for patients, ensuring seamless interaction between both ends.  

Additionally, it includes an **AI-based health suggestion module** that predicts possible conditions based on symptoms provided by patients.
